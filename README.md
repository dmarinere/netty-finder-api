 NettyFinder :rocket:

This is an API verison of the original [netty-finder](https://github.com/BolajiAyodeji/netty-finder) that was written in JavaScript


# Usage
Visit `https://netty-api.herokuapp.com/api/` + phone_number using a web browser or Postman. 
It would return the network it belongs to in a JSON format which is also viewable in your browser.

# About Author

This was originally built by [Bolaji Ayodeji](https://github.com/BolajiAyodeji) so all rights goes to him, I only converted it to an api and deployed it on heroku

# Contribution
 
For now, I dont accept contributions except its from the javascript [netty_finder](https://github.com/BolajiAyodeji/netty-finder), so I suggest you contribute there. Any changes from there will be added to the python version
