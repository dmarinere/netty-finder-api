# About Author

This was originally built by [Bolaji Ayodeji](https://github.com/BolajiAyodeji) so all rights goes to him, I only interpreted the javascript code to es6 and package to npm

# Contribution
 
For now, I dont accept contributions except its from the javascript [netty_finder](https://github.com/BolajiAyodeji/netty-finder), so I suggest you contribute there. Any changes from there will be added to the python version
